## soo, what do you do?

I'm a developer!
  
I specialize in js, python and java.  
I'm going to try to learn `nim` in the next ~month.   
This website should be entirely written in `nim` :D  
 
I am also trying to use c++.. Please do not offer me c++ it's very hard for me to do..

i am also beginning work on a blog! visit [yourfriend.lv/blog](https://yourfriend.lv/blog)!
